# Overview

The React_Gear is aim to help wi the mix of basic apps that usually are send to developers are exercises to know the basic on the frontend with React. 
This folder projects was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Projects to tackle here
- Calculator, basic operations and slight visual based on material ui 
- Remind me To Do app, basic list of todo where as user can edit, delete and filter tasks based on 3 criterias. Also some of basic on accesibility features, for screen readers tech

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run even npm or yarn:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your To Do app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

Really you can use any of the available free solution for deploys that offers an easy and intuitive path to put your app online, so far I've been using Zeit, called now Vercel and Netlify.

## Notes

Under new challenges every week, build with tons of love and coffee!!!
